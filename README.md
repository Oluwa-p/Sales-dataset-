### Data cleaning/Preparation

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;

- what is the total sales?
- what is the total profit?
- what is the total sales by country?
- what is the total product sold?
- what is the total by product and country?
- what is the total sales by product and segment?
- what is the average unit price by country and discount band?

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company sales increased within the year 2009 to 2010 and reduces in the year 2011 and 2012.
2. The Highest total sales by country is united States of America, followed by Canada, France, Germany and Mexico.
3. paseo is the highest total unit of product sold.

### Recommendation 

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions
- Invest in marketing and promotion during the later year sales seasons to maximise revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting product across country.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove zero values from unit prices column because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusion from the analysis,even after the omissions we can see that there is a positive correlation between the revenue and profit.
